Brubeck is a journalism-focused CMS in development by students and former 
students of the University of Missouri. It is an ongoing effort to expand the 
CMS of The Maneater, MU's official student newspaper, to be useful for other 
news organizations.

Most of Brubeck is usable, but it has not been tested in its entirety. Use at 
your own risk.
